# ranked-choice

## takeaways
Ranked choice voting allows progressive voters to voice support for progressive candidates, while also indicating a pragmatic choice between moderate candidates on the ballot.

While it may be tempting for a progressive voter to list only one or two progressive candidates, this strategy can have the effect of not voting at all.

Democracy Journal warns us about this [very scenario](https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/ranked-choice-voting-is-not-the-solution/):

"Say there are five candidates running, but the voter ranks only three, and all three are eliminated prior to the last round. As a result, none of their votes will have gone to the winning candidate or the runner-up. In effect, their ballot doesnâ€™t figure in the outcome."

Since the results below show a high likelihood that ranked choice ballot tabulations for NYC's competitive 2021 mayoral race will go through five or more rounds of elimination, many progressive ballots with fewer than five selections will be eliminated. 

**The bottom line:** progressive voters should make sure their ballots count by voting for five candidates total (the maximum allowed).
